## Root Cause and Resolution

### **💣 The Problem:**
A simple, but critical, error in the database connection settings during a routine update. The new setting drastically limited the number of connections available, leading to our Django app choking under normal traffic. Result? Complete service outage.

### **🔧 The Fix:**
We quickly rolled back to the previous, stable settings and corrected the connection configuration to handle expected traffic. A few server restarts later, and we were back on track with normal operations.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

### **What We Learned:**
1. **🔍 Review Every Change:** No more sneaky settings! We’ll double-check all configuration changes for performance impact.
2. **⚠️ Smarter Monitoring:** We’re adding alerts for database connection pool usage to catch issues before they spiral out of control.

### **Action Items:**

- **👀 Monitor It:** Implement monitoring for the connection pool to catch low connections early.
- **✅ Automate It:** Update the deployment process with automatic checks for critical settings.
- **📚 Document It:** Review and share best practices for database settings across the team.
- **👥 Train It:** Hold a post-incident session to discuss what happened and how to avoid it in the future.
